      We’re proud to announce that Northern Flights Disc Golf has giving our first Diamond Award to <strong>Saskatchewan Parks and Recreation</strong>, along with a grant of over <strong>$2,000</strong>! Full details will be shared once financial statements are released at the end of the month.
    </p>

    <p>
      We’ve also secured our official domain: <strong>northernflightsdiscgolf.com</strong>, allowing us to grow our outreach and improve our online presence.
    </p>

    <p>
      In media news, we’ve pre-released a commercial for an upcoming project. You can watch it here:<br />

    </p>

    <p>
      Our YouTube channel now features four video reels, and we’ll soon be recovering our disc golf baskets that were left behind during the wildfire evacuation.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the support from our grant, we’re still moving forward with our plans for the <strong>Traveling Disc Golf Wellness Tour</strong>. Once we return home, we’ll assess the situation and determine next steps for local leagues and events.

      <h2>Pride Month: United as Disc Golfers, Respecting All People</h2>
      <img src="static/Photos/Logos/Pride logo.png" alt="Pride Logo" style="width: auto; max-height: 75vh;" />
      
      <p>June is Pride Month. A time to celebrate diversity, inclusion, and the freedom for everyone to be their true selves. 
        At the end of the day, we're all disc golfers first, united by our love for the game and the community it builds. 
        No matter who you are or who you love, you’re welcome on the course. Let’s continue to respect and support one another, 
        on and off the fairway.

      <h2>Important Notice: The Flin Flon Spring League is cancelled until Further Notice</h2>
      <img src="static/Photos/fire logo.png" alt="Fire Logo" style="width: auto; max-height: 75vh;" />
      
      <p>In light of the recent mandatory evacuation order issued for Flin Flon due to the ongoing wildfire and the associated safety risks, we have to cancel the 2025 Flin Flon Spring League. The health and well-being of our players and their families must take priority during this emergency. 
        We extend our deepest gratitude to the brave firefighters, emergency responders, and support personnel who continue to work around the clock to protect our community. Your courage, dedication, and selflessness are truly appreciated.
        Please follow all official evacuation instructions and safety advisories from local authorities. We will monitor conditions closely and hope to return to the course when it is safe for everyone. Stay safe, and thank you for your understanding and support.
